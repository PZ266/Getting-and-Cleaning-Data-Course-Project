CodeBook.md a code book that describes the codes 

run_analysis.R is data 

FinalData.txt is final data after work has been done

The goal of the project is to prepare tidy data based on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, that can be used for later analysis.

The project repo includes the following files:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A README.md - direct link to README 🏁
A tidy data set named "tidy_data_set.txt" - direct link to the tidy data set 🏁
A CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data. - direct link to the CodeBook 🏁
R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 🏁
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
A link here to the Github repository with all the scripts/files listed above 🏁
